The project is a basic python implementation of a tcp socket
It requires nothing other than python 3.x

## Server
The server can be ran from the command line with:

```
python server.py
```
## Client
The client can be ran in the same way with:

```
python client.py
```
The client and server processes can both be killed by sending the message "terminate" from the client to the server
